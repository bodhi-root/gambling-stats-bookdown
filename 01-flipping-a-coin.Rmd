# Flipping a Coin (and Basic Probabilities) {#flipping-a-coin}

The simplest game of chance I can imagine is flipping a coin.  A fair coin will have a 50% chance of coming up heads and 50% chance of coming up tails. A fair bet is one that pays even money.  That means that if you bet \$1 on a particular outcome (heads or tails), you win \$1 if you're right and lose \$1 if you're wrong. In gambling terms the ["odds"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds) are 1-to-1, meaning there is an equal probability of each outcome, and a fair bet will pay 1-to-1, meaning that the dollar you bet is matched with 1 dollar you win.

The expected value of such a wager is calculated as:

$$ Expected Value = Pr(win) * (\$1) + Pr(lose) * (-\$1) = 0.5 * (\$1) + 0.5 * (-\$1) = \$0 $$

This is the basic means of calculating any expectation in statistics.  First, you find the probabilities or each event.  Next, you multiply each probability by the expected return in each scenario.  And then you add those all together.  The difficult part is usually finding the probabilities or each outcome, especially in games that involve player's making choices where you also must work to find the optimal choice in any scenario.
