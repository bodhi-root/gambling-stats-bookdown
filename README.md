# Gambling Stats (Bookdown)

This is yet another attempt by me to record some of my favorite applications of statistics and computer analysis: gambling.  I've tried this before in different formats: notebooks, Word, Confluence.  I'd like to build it in a way that is:

1. Easy to edit and add new topics
2. Easy to convert to new formats, if needed
3. Persistent

I think bookdown will meet these needs, allowing me to build the content of the book in markdown and persit it in GitHub.  Let's see how it goes.

When creating this book I began with the simple "bookdown-demo", deleted some files, altered some titles, and then started writing.
