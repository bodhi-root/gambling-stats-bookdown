[["index.html", "Gambling Statistics Introduction", " Gambling Statistics Dan Rogers 2020-10-18 Introduction I remember being about 16 years old, spending a few weeks each summer at Devils Lake with my grandparents. One of the fun things we would do is get the felt casino cover for the table out. It had a Blackjack table on one side and Craps on the other. Grandpa would be the house, calling out our bets, informing us of bad bets, and paying out the winner. During one of those summers, I had just learned about calculating sums for inifinite series. I remember trying to calculate the odds on craps, and realizing it was an infinite series that could be summed just like we had learned in class. This was really quite amazing. While it was widely believed we would never actually use the math we were learning in class, here was a great example of how it can be used in real life That example of using math to calculate the expected returns in craps stands out in my mind as something that really drove my interest in gambling and applying statistics to different games. It wasnt too long after that I was also building computer simulations for games like Blackjack and Poker, trying to re-create basic strategy and the different statistical tables I had seen for Texas Hold Em. Now Ill be the first to admit: this is well-trodden ground that doesnt require any new work or discovery by me. The Wizard of Odds has already calculated statistics and expected returns for pretty much any game you can imagine. There really isnt any value in me going through and calculating them all myself except that I like it. I think its fun, and Ive decided that is reason enough. I intend to put my notes here as I accumulate them, adding a chapter for each game or subject. Theres even a chance that this could turn into a good reference for statistics applied to gambling games. I intend to start with the most basic games and build up to the more complex. So maybe there is some value in arranging the content in this way and emphasizing the math that gets you to the answer rather than just the result. But really, when it comes down to it, I just find this a fun way to spend time, and that is all that matters. "],["flipping-a-coin.html", "1 Flipping a Coin (and Basic Probabilities)", " 1 Flipping a Coin (and Basic Probabilities) U.S. Quarter The simplest game of chance I can imagine is flipping a coin. A fair coin will have a 50% chance of coming up heads and 50% chance of coming up tails. A fair bet is one that pays even money. That means that if you bet $1 on a particular outcome (heads or tails), you win $1 if youre right and lose $1 if youre wrong. In gambling terms the odds are 1-to-1, meaning there is an equal probability of each outcome, and a fair bet will pay 1-to-1, meaning that the dollar you bet is matched with 1 dollar you win. The expected value of such a wager is calculated as: \\[ Expected Value = Pr(win) * (\\$1) + Pr(lose) * (-\\$1) = 0.5 * (\\$1) + 0.5 * (-\\$1) = \\$0 \\] This is the basic means of calculating any expectation in statistics. First, you find the probabilities or each event. Next, you multiply each probability by the expected return in each scenario. And then you add those all together. The difficult part is usually finding the probabilities or each outcome, especially in games that involve players making choices where you also must work to find the optimal choice in any scenario. "],["roulette.html", "2 Roulette", " 2 Roulette Roulette Table Roulette is a fun and simple game where a large wheel is spun and then a ball is dropped into the wheel. Players bet on where the ball will land. The main numbers range from 1 to 36 and are divided into half red and half black. There is also an additional number: zero that is neither red nor black (nor is it even or odd). In most games, you will find zero (0) and double zero (00). The presence of these numbers is what gives the house its edge in the game. There are a variety of bets that can be made in Roulette: Red or black, paying 1-to-1 Even or odd, paying 1-to-1 Any single number (Straight Up), paying 35-to-1 Two adjacent numbers (Split), paying 17 to 1 Three numbers in a row (Street), paying 11 to 1 Four adjoining numbers (Corner), paying 8 to 1 Twelve numbers, either sequential (Dozen) or in a Column, paying 2 to 1 1-18 or 19-36, paying 1-to-1 Interestingly, the expected return on all of these bets is exactly the same. To show why this is true, lets calculate a few. First, well calculate my favorite bet: red or black, paying even money. \\[ Expected Value = \\frac{18}{38} * (\\$1) + \\frac{20}{38} * (-\\$1) = -\\frac{2}{38} = -0.05263158 \\] Notice that this bet is almost like flipping a coin (1). In fact, if the zeroes were not on the board and we only had 36 numbers, it would be identical. However, the presence of the zeroes means that we have 38 outcomes, not 36, and the 2 new outcomes that are introduced by the presence of the zero are losses for us. This turns the expected return slightly negative, giving the house a 5.26% edge. However much money we place on this bet, we should expect to lose an average of 5.26% with each spin of the wheel. Lets calculate another one. Obviously, the even or odd bet will be the same. So lets do a straight up bet on a single number. The expected return in this case is: \\[ Expected Value = \\frac{1}{38} * (\\$35) + \\frac{37}{38} * (-\\$1) = -\\frac{2}{38} = -0.05263158 \\] As suggested, this is the the same house edge as the red/black or even/odd bet. Knowing that the payout on any bet is equal to the true odds in the absence of the zeroes, we can see that this will always come out the same way. Just to demonstrate this, here are the expected values for bets place on 4 and 12 numbers: \\[ Expected Value = \\frac{4}{38} * (\\$8) + \\frac{34}{38} * (-\\$1) = -\\frac{2}{38} = -0.05263158 \\] \\[ Expected Value = \\frac{12}{38} * (\\$2) + \\frac{26}{38} * (-\\$1) = -\\frac{2}{38} = -0.05263158 \\] So far we have analyzed American roulette, which has both zero and double zero. European roulette instead only has 1 zero. Intuitively, we know that this will improve our odds. Specifically, we find that a single number bet now has the expected value: \\[ Expected Value = \\frac{1}{37} * (\\$1) + \\frac{36}{37} * (-\\$1) = -\\frac{1}{37} = 0.02702703 \\] The house edge has been cut almost in half, from 5.26% to 2.70%. As with American roulette, all of the other bets will have this same expected value and house edge. Obviously, it is advantageous to players to play at European style tables whenever possible. "],["craps.html", "3 Craps 3.1 Dice Odds 3.2 Single Roll (proposition) Bets 3.3 Multi-Roll Bets 3.4 Line Bets 3.5 Summary", " 3 Craps Craps Table As mentioned in the introduction, craps is the game that fascinated me the most in terms of how it could be modeled mathematically. There are a variety of bets in craps. Wikipedia divides them into three types: Line Bets (pass line, dont pass line, come line, and dont come line) Multi-Roll Bets (place and hard way bets) Single-Roll Bets The single-roll bets are the easiest to analyze, so well start there. But the line bets (in particular the pass line) is where things really get fun. 3.1 Dice Odds Since we havent discussed this previously, lets take a quick detour and discuss the odds of different outcomes when rolling a pair of die. The outcomes and probabilities of each outcome are shown below: Outcome Ways to Roll It Probability 2 1 \\[ \\frac{1}{36} \\approx 2.78\\% \\] 3 2 \\[ \\frac{2}{36} \\approx 5.56\\% \\] 4 3 \\[ \\frac{3}{36} \\approx 8.33\\% \\] 5 4 \\[ \\frac{4}{36} \\approx 11.11\\% \\] 6 5 \\[ \\frac{5}{36} \\approx 13.89\\% \\] 7 6 \\[ \\frac{6}{36} \\approx 16.67\\% \\] 8 5 \\[ \\frac{5}{36} \\approx 13.89\\% \\] 9 4 \\[ \\frac{4}{36} \\approx 11.11\\% \\] 10 3 \\[ \\frac{3}{36} \\approx 8.33\\% \\] 11 2 \\[ \\frac{2}{36} \\approx 5.56\\% \\] 12 1 \\[ \\frac{1}{36} \\approx 2.78\\% \\] Notice that the most likely outcome of any roll is 7. This is important in craps where many bets are either betting for or betting against a 7 being thrown. The least likely numbers to occur are 2 and 12 since there is only one combination of the die that result in each of these. 3.2 Single Roll (proposition) Bets Single roll bets are the easiest to analyze because you only bet on one throw of the die. You either win or lose based on the outcome, and the results can be calculated very easily. Examples of these bets include: Field Service Bets (the bets in the middle, including snake eyes, box cars, and other specific outcomes) C&amp;E Bets 3.2.1 Service Bets Once again, well start with the easiest of these: the service bets. These are the bets in the middle of the table. They show a specific outcome (such as snake eyes or box cars) and the payout for winning. The table below quickly summarizes the results of these bets: Bet Payout Probability Expected Return 2, 12 30 to 1 \\[ \\frac{1}{36} \\approx 2.78\\% \\] \\[ \\frac{30}{36} - \\frac{35}{36} = -\\frac{5}{36} \\approx -13.89\\% \\] 3, 11 15 to 1 \\[ \\frac{2}{36} \\approx 5.56\\% \\] \\[ \\frac{15*2}{36} - \\frac{34}{36} = -\\frac{4}{36} \\approx -11.11\\% \\] Any Craps 7 to 1 \\[ \\frac{4}{36} \\approx 11.11\\% \\] \\[ \\frac{7*4}{36} - \\frac{32}{36} = -\\frac{4}{36} \\approx -11.11\\% \\] Any 7 4 to 1 \\[ \\frac{6}{36} \\approx 16.67\\% \\] \\[ \\frac{4*6}{36} - \\frac{30}{36} = -\\frac{6}{36} \\approx -16.67\\% \\] 3.2.2 C&amp;E The C&amp;E bet is a combined bet where you are betting half your money on craps and half on eleven. The payouts on each half of the bet are the same as in the service bet table. The result is that a craps win pays out 3-to-1 and a win on 11 pays out 7-to-1. To understand why, imagine you bet $2 and roll craps. The $1 you bet on craps returns 7-to-1, but you lose the $1 you bet on 11. This means you get $6 for your $2 bet. If you bet $2 and roll 11, the $1 you bet here wins $15. You lose the $1 you bet on craps, so you get $14 back for your $2 bet. With these modified payouts in mind, here are the expectations of this bet: Outcome Payout Probability Result Craps $3 \\[ \\frac{4}{36} \\approx 11.11\\% \\] \\[ \\frac{12}{36} \\approx 0.3333 \\] 11 $7 \\[ \\frac{2}{36} \\approx 5.56\\% \\] \\[ \\frac{14}{36} \\approx 0.3389 \\] Lose -$1 \\[ \\frac{30}{36} \\approx 83.33\\% \\] \\[ -\\frac{30}{36} \\approx -0.8333 \\] Total 100% \\[ -\\frac{4}{36} \\approx -0.1111 \\] The result is a -11.11% return. This shouldnt be surprising since this is the same return on the 11 bet and the Any Craps bet individually. If we bet them as a combined bet, we should expect the same return. 3.2.3 Field The Field bet is a one-roll bet that wins if you roll a 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, or 12. The bet pays even money on everything except the 2 and 12. These will either both pay 2-to-1 or the 2 will pay 2-to-1 and the 12 will pay 3-to-1. The outcomes and payouts for both pay schedules are shown below: Outcome Probability Payout (2-to-1 on 12) Payout (3-to-1 on 12) 12 \\[ \\frac{1}{36} \\approx 2.78\\% \\] $2 $3 2 \\[ \\frac{1}{36} \\approx 2.78\\% \\] $2 $2 3, 4, 9, 10, 11 \\[ \\frac{2+3+4+3+2}{36} = \\frac{14}{36} \\approx 38.89\\% \\] $1 $1 5, 6, 7, 8 \\[ \\frac{4+5+6+5}{36} = \\frac{20}{36} \\approx 55.56\\% \\] -$1 -$1 If you do the weighted sum (probability * payout) you will find the following expected returns: 2-to-1 on 12 : \\(\\frac{2+2+14-20}{36} = -\\frac{2}{36} \\approx -5.56\\%\\) 3-to-1 on 12 : \\(\\frac{3+2+14-20}{36} = -\\frac{1}{36} \\approx -2.78\\%\\) 3.3 Multi-Roll Bets Multi-roll bets are typically bets that a specific number will be rolled before rolling a 7. An example of these are the hard way bets where you can bet that a 4 will be rolled as doubles before a 7. The bet will not resolve until one of these events happens, meaning that several rolls of the die are likely to occur before you win or lose. This is where we will need to make use of our formulas for summing infinite series. Specifically, we will need the formula for the sum of a geometric series: \\[ \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{\\infty}{r^{k}} = \\frac{1}{1-r} \\] which is applicable when $ |r| &lt; 1 $ . 3.3.1 Big 6 &amp; Big 8 Big 6 and Big 8 bets are notoriously bad bets. Experienced players avoid them (and some casinos dont even put them on the table) because you can make a place bet that is effectively the same bet with a better payout. However, these are easy ones with which we can begin our multi-roll outcome analysis. The big 6 bet wins if a 6 comes up before a 7. Similarly, the big 8 bet wins if an 8 comes up before a 7. Since 6 and 8 are equally-likely to be rolled, we can calculate their odds together. Each bet pays even money. On any roll we have the following 3 outcomes: Outcome Probability Win \\[ \\frac{5}{36} \\approx 13.89\\% \\] Lose \\[ \\frac{6}{36} \\approx 16.67\\% \\] Continue \\[ \\frac{25}{36} \\approx 69.44\\% \\] Eventually, we will have to either win or lose, although we may have any number of continue rolls occur before that final result. This means that the odds of winning are: \\[ \\frac{5}{36} + \\frac{25}{36} \\frac{5}{36} + (\\frac{25}{36})^{2} \\frac{5}{36} + \\dots = \\frac{5}{36} \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{\\infty}{(\\frac{25}{36})^{k}} \\] The first term in this infinite series represents the probability of winning on the first roll; the second term, the second roll; etc.. We can use the formula for summing an infinite series to get the total probability of winning as: \\[ \\frac{5}{36} \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{\\infty}{(\\frac{25}{36})^{k}} = \\frac{5}{36} \\frac{1}{1-\\frac{25}{36}} = \\frac{5}{36} \\frac{36}{11} = \\frac{5}{11} \\approx 45.45\\% \\] While we know that the odds of losing must be the complement of this (\\(\\frac{6}{11}\\)) we can also work these out the long way and sum them as an infinite series as well. The result will be: \\[ \\frac{6}{36} \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{\\infty}{(\\frac{25}{36})^{k}} = \\frac{6}{36} \\frac{1}{1-\\frac{25}{36}} = \\frac{6}{36} \\frac{36}{11} = \\frac{6}{11} \\approx 54.54\\% \\] This means that the expected return of this bet is: \\[ \\frac{5}{11} * 1 + \\frac{6}{11} * (-1) = -\\frac{1}{11} \\approx 9.09\\% \\] 3.3.2 Hard-Way Bets Hard-way bets pay out if you roll a specific number (4, 6, 8, or 10) the hard way (i.e. as doubles) before you roll it the soft way or roll a 7. The odds for 4 and 10 are the same, as they are also for 6 and 8. The table below illustrates the outcomes and probabilities for 4 and 10: Outcome Probability Win \\[ \\frac{1}{36} \\approx 2.78\\% \\] Lose \\[ \\frac{6}{36} + \\frac{2}{36} = \\frac{8}{36} \\approx 22.22\\% \\] Continue \\[ \\frac{27}{36} = 75\\% \\] This means the total probability of winning is: \\[ \\frac{1}{36} \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{\\infty}{(\\frac{27}{36})^{k}} = \\frac{1}{36} \\frac{1}{1-\\frac{27}{36}} = \\frac{1}{36} \\frac{36}{9} = \\frac{1}{9} \\approx 11.11\\% \\] This bet pays out 7-to-1. The expected return is thus: \\[ \\frac{1*7}{9} - \\frac{8}{9} = -\\frac{1}{9} \\approx -11.11\\% \\] When betting hard 6 or 8 the outcomes are as shown: Outcome Probability Win \\[ \\frac{1}{36} \\approx 2.78\\% \\] Lose \\[ \\frac{6}{36} + \\frac{4}{36} = \\frac{10}{36} \\approx 27.78\\% \\] Continue \\[ \\frac{25}{36} \\approx 69.44\\% \\] This means the total probability of winning is: \\[ \\frac{1}{36} \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{\\infty}{(\\frac{25}{36})^{k}} = \\frac{1}{36} \\frac{1}{1-\\frac{25}{36}} = \\frac{1}{36} \\frac{36}{11} = \\frac{1}{11} \\approx 9.09\\% \\] The probability of winning on a hard 6 or 8 is lower than that of a 4 or 10 because there are more soft ways to roll these numbers and thus higher probabilities of losing. The payout is higher though, at 9-to-1 it gives the following expected return: \\[ \\frac{1*9}{11} - \\frac{10}{11} = -\\frac{1}{11} \\approx -9.09\\% \\] NOTE: Many craps tables (including the image in this section) show the odds as 8 to 1 for the hard 4 and 10 and 10 to 1 for hard 6 and 8. These really mean 8 for 1 and 10 for 1 which are the equivalent of 7 to 1 and 9 to 1. 3.3.3 Place Bets Place bets can be made on the numbers 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10. These are bets that the corresponding number will be rolled before a 7. The payouts for these bets are 9-to-5 on 4 or 10, 7-to-5 on 5 or 9, and 7-to-6 on 6 or 8. (You can now see why the Big 6 and Big 8 bets are discouraged since you can make the same bet here and get a 7-to-6 payout rather than even money.) The probabilities of outcomes for different points are shown below: Point Win Lose Continue 4 or 10 \\[ \\frac{3}{36} \\approx 8.33\\% \\] \\[ \\frac{6}{36} \\approx 16.67\\% \\] \\[ \\frac{27}{36} = 75\\% \\] 5 or 9 \\[ \\frac{4}{36} \\approx 11.11\\% \\] \\[ \\frac{6}{36} \\approx 16.67\\% \\] \\[ \\frac{26}{36} \\approx 72.22\\% \\] 6 or 8 \\[ \\frac{5}{36} \\approx 13.89\\% \\] \\[ \\frac{6}{36} \\approx 16.67\\% \\] \\[ \\frac{25}{36} \\approx 69.44\\% \\] The probability of winning on 4 or 10 is: \\[ \\frac{3}{36} \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{\\infty}{(\\frac{27}{36})^{k}} = \\frac{3}{36} \\frac{1}{1-\\frac{27}{36}} = \\frac{3}{36} \\frac{36}{9} = \\frac{3}{9} \\approx 33.33\\% \\] The expected return is: \\[ [\\frac{1}{3}(9) + \\frac{2}{3}(-5)] / 5 = -\\frac{1}{15} \\approx -6.67\\% \\] Note that we divide by 5 when calculating this return because we calculated returns on a $5 bet. In order to get this as a percentage that is relevant to any bet size we divide by the amount bet. When 5 or 9 is the point, we have: \\[ \\frac{4}{36} \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{\\infty}{(\\frac{26}{36})^{k}} = \\frac{4}{36} \\frac{1}{1-\\frac{26}{36}} = \\frac{4}{36} \\frac{36}{10} = \\frac{4}{10} = 40\\% \\] and the expected return: \\[ [\\frac{4}{10}(7) + \\frac{6}{10}(-5)] / 5 = -\\frac{2}{50} = 4\\% \\] When 6 or 8 is the point, we have: \\[ \\frac{5}{36} \\sum\\limits_{k=0}^{\\infty}{(\\frac{25}{36})^{k}} = \\frac{5}{36} \\frac{1}{1-\\frac{25}{36}} = \\frac{5}{36} \\frac{36}{11} = \\frac{5}{11} \\approx 45.45\\% \\] and the expected return: \\[ [\\frac{5}{11}(7) + \\frac{6}{11}(-6)] / 6 = -\\frac{1}{66} \\approx 1.52\\% \\] To summarize, we have: Point Payout Probability of Win Expected Return 4 or 10 9-to-5 \\[ \\frac{3}{9} \\approx 33.33\\% \\] \\[ -\\frac{1}{15} \\approx -6.67\\% \\] 5 or 9 7-to-5 \\[ \\frac{4}{10} = 40\\% \\] \\[ -\\frac{2}{50} = -4\\% \\] 6 or 8 7-to-6 \\[ \\frac{5}{11} \\approx 45.45\\% \\] \\[ -\\frac{1}{66} \\approx -1.52\\% \\] 3.3.4 Buy Bets A buy bet is similar to a place bet except that it pays true odds. In exchange for this, the house takes a 5% commission. According to Wikipedia, the minimum bet is usually $20 so that the house can easily take its $1 commission. The Wizard of Odds calculates the odds as if he gave the house $1 but left $20 on the table for is bet (a 4.76%) commission. We will proceed using this same calculation. When the point is 4 or 10 we then have: \\[ [\\frac{1}{3}(39) + \\frac{2}{3}(-21)] / 21 = -\\frac{1}{21} \\approx -4.76\\% \\] NOTE: We divide by 21 in the equation because we are betting $21. When we lose, we lose all $21 that we bet. When we win, we should win true odds (2 to 1) for a payout of $40. We get $60 total coming back our way, but we spent $21. This means we really only have a gain of $39. When the point is 5 or 9 we have: \\[ [\\frac{4}{10}(29) + \\frac{6}{10}(-21)] / 21 = -\\frac{1}{21} = -4.76\\% \\] This is similar to before. The odds of winning are 4-to-6, so the true odds payout is 6-to-4. This means we win $30 on our $20 bet that is left after paying the $1 commission. This means the total gain on our bet when we win is $29. When the point is 6 or 8 we have: \\[ [\\frac{5}{11}(23) + \\frac{6}{11}(-21)] / 21 = -\\frac{1}{21} \\approx -4.76\\% \\] Now the odds of winning are 5-to-6, meaning the true odds payout is 6-to-5. This means we win $24 on our $20 bet and have $23 gain when we win. To summarize, we have: Point Payout Probability of Win Expected Return 4 or 10 2-to-1 \\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 33.33\\% \\] \\[ -\\frac{1}{21} \\approx -4.76\\% \\] 5 or 9 3-to-2 \\[ \\frac{2}{5} = 40\\% \\] \\[ -\\frac{1}{21} \\approx -4.76\\% \\] 6 or 8 6-to-5 \\[ \\frac{5}{11} \\approx 45.45\\% \\] \\[ -\\frac{1}{21} \\approx -4.76\\% \\] The probabilities of winning are the same as with the place bets. The expected returns are actually worse on most of these bets though - everything except when the point is a 4 or 10. 3.4 Line Bets Finally, we get to the main bet in craps: the pass line bet (and its derivatives). 3.4.1 Pass Line The pass line bet is a bet that wins immediately when you roll a 7 or 11 and loses immediately if you roll craps (2, 3, or 12). If you roll any other number, that number becomes the point and you win if you roll it again before rolling a 7. The payout is even money. Well have to deal with this bet in two parts. First, we will examine the initial roll - since it is so different from the rest. Then we can look at the remaining rolls where the player is trying to roll their point before rolling a 7. This part of the game will be identical in its probabilities to the place and buy bets we examined previously. On the first roll, we have the following outcomes: Outcome Probability Win (7 or 11) \\[ \\frac{6+2}{36} = \\frac{2}{9} \\approx 22.22\\% \\] Lose (2, 3, or 12) \\[ \\frac{1+2+1}{36} = \\frac{1}{9} \\approx 11.11\\% \\] Continue \\[ \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 66.67\\% \\] We have already calculated the probabilities of rolling a specific point before rolling a 7. These are the probabilities that will determine whether we win if do not immediately win or lose on the first roll. As a reminder, these probabilities are: Point Probability of Occurring Probability of Win 4 or 10 \\[ 2 * \\frac{3}{36} = \\frac{1}{6} \\approx 16.67\\% \\] \\[ \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 33.33\\% \\] 5 or 9 \\[ 2 * \\frac{4}{36} = \\frac{2}{9} \\approx 22.22\\% \\] \\[ \\frac{2}{5} = 40\\% \\] 6 or 8 \\[ 2 * \\frac{5}{36} = \\frac{5}{18} \\approx 27.78\\% \\] \\[ \\frac{5}{11} \\approx 45.45\\% \\] Any \\[ \\frac{3+4+5}{18} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 66.67\\% \\] \\[ \\frac{134}{330} \\approx 40.61\\% \\] The very last number in the table might need explaining. This is calculated by multiplying the probability of each event by the probability of winning, summing them up, and then dividing by the total probability of these events. The first sum gives us: \\[ \\frac{1}{6}\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{9}\\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{5}{18}\\frac{5}{11} = \\frac{268}{990} \\approx 27.07\\% \\] This is the probability of establishing a point and then winning. If we just want the probability of winning given that we have established a point already, we need to divide by \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), which is the probability of establishing a point in the first place. This gives that final probability of winning as \\(\\frac{134}{330}\\). We now have all the information we need to calculate the total probability of winning this bet. It is equal to the probability of winning on the first roll (\\(\\frac{2}{9}\\)) plus the probability of establising a point (\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)) multiplied by the probability of winning once that point is established (\\(\\frac{134}{330}\\)). This is: \\[ \\frac{2}{9} + \\frac{2}{3}\\frac{134}{330} = \\frac{448}{990} = \\frac{244}{495} \\approx 49.29\\% \\] The expected value of this bet is then: \\[ \\frac{244}{495} - \\frac{251}{495} = -\\frac{7}{495} \\approx -1.41\\% \\] This is one of the best bets in the casino. It has a very low house edge. It is definitely better than any of the other bets we have calculated so far in craps. And with pass odds, it can get even better. 3.4.2 Pass odds Pass odds is a bet that can be made behind the pass line once a point is established. This is a bet that the point will be made before rolling a 7. Unlike any other bet in the game (or in the casino), this bet pays true odds. This means it pays 2-to-1 on 4 and 10, 3-to-2 on 5 and 9, and 6-to-5 on 6 and 8. As grandpa would say: Youre an idiot if you dont make this bet. Its the best bet in the house. Youll want to make sure you bet enough to get the full payout. A bet of $10 is enough to do this regardless of the point. Casinos typically limit how much you are allowed to bet here. Common limitations are single odds (equal to your pass line bet) and double odds (equal to twice your pass line bet). Some will offer higher limits though or even no limit at all. If you combine this bet with your original pass line bet and calculate the total return, the house edge will shrink below 1.41%. The larger your pass odds bet, the smaller the house edge. This is because the house is only making money off your original bet. There is no house edge on your pass odds bet. Lets calculate the expected return on a pass line bet combined with an odds bet behind it. First, well bring back the equation for the expected return on a pass line bet: \\[ \\frac{2}{9}(1) + \\frac{1}{9}(-1) + \\frac{2}{3}(\\frac{134}{330}(1) + \\frac{196}{330}(-1)) \\] Remember the terms in this equation relate to: Winning on the first roll (\\(\\frac{2}{9}\\)) Losing on the first roll (\\(\\frac{1}{9}\\)) Continuing beyond the first roll (\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)) to: Win (\\(\\frac{134}{330}\\)) Lose (\\(\\frac{196}{330}\\)) We could try to add in terms that reflect the payout on the pass odds bet. These would only be relevant in the cases where we continue beyond the first roll (which only happens \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of the time). While the payouts vary based on the point, the expected value of the payouts on the pass odds bet do not change. They are always zero. If the point were 4 the expected value of our pass odds bet is: \\[ \\frac{1}{3}(2) + \\frac{2}{3}(-1) = 0 \\] So if we do add these terms into the second half of the equation they will all disappear, leaving us with the original equation. The one thing that does change though is the amount of money we bet. In \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the cases, we will win after the first roll, meaning we stick with our original bet of $1. In \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) of the cases we will get to put another bet behind the line, increasing our total bet to $2. The weighted average of these is: \\[ \\frac{1}{3}(1) + \\frac{2}{3}(2) = \\frac{5}{3} \\] This is the average amount we will bet on any hand. Dividing our original equation by this to get it in terms of the amount bet yields: \\[ -\\frac{7}{495} / \\frac{5}{3} = -\\frac{7}{825} \\approx 0.81\\% \\] Similarly, if we are allowed to double-down behind the line, our overall return based on the money in play is now: \\[ -\\frac{7}{495} / (\\frac{1}{3}(1) + \\frac{2}{3}(3)) = -\\frac{1}{165} \\approx 0.61\\% \\] 3.4.3 Dont Pass The dont pass bet is basically the opposite of the pass line bet. It is a somewhat unpopular bet because it means you are betting against the shooter (and they dont tend to like that). The bet wins immediately on 2 or 3. It pushes on a 12. (In some casinos it wins on 3 or 12 and pushes on 2, but this does not affect the odds). If a point is established, you are then betting against the player making his point. You win if a 7 is rolled before they make their point, and you lose if they make the point. Note that the push on a 12 (or a 2) is necessary for the house to maintain its edge. If you were to have a bet that was truly the opposite of the pass line, it would mean that youd have a positive advantage in the game. The first roll has the following outcomes and probabilities: Outcome Probability Push (12) \\[ \\frac{1}{36} \\approx 2.78\\% \\] Win (2, 3) \\[ \\frac{1+2}{36} = \\frac{1}{12} \\approx 8.33\\% \\] Lose (7 or 11) \\[ \\frac{6+2}{36} = \\frac{2}{9} \\approx 22.22\\% \\] Continue \\[ \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 66.67\\% \\] The probability against making the points are simply the complements from the pass line bet table. These are: Point Probability of Occurring Probability of Win 4 or 10 \\[ 2 * \\frac{3}{36} = \\frac{1}{6} \\approx 16.67\\% \\] \\[ \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 66.67\\% \\] 5 or 9 \\[ 2 * \\frac{4}{36} = \\frac{2}{9} \\approx 22.22\\% \\] \\[ \\frac{3}{5} = 60\\% \\] 6 or 8 \\[ 2 * \\frac{5}{36} = \\frac{5}{18} \\approx 27.78\\% \\] \\[ \\frac{6}{11} \\approx 54.54\\% \\] Any \\[ \\frac{3+4+5}{18} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 66.67\\% \\] \\[ \\frac{196}{330} \\approx 59.39\\% \\] The total probability of winning is then: \\[ \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{2}{3}\\frac{196}{330} = \\frac{949}{1980} \\approx 47.93\\% \\] The expected value of this bet is then: \\[ \\frac{949}{1980}(1) + \\frac{1}{36}(0) + \\frac{976}{1980}(-1) = -\\frac{27}{1980} = -\\frac{3}{220} \\approx -1.36\\% \\] This is actually a slightly better bet than the pass line bet. However, you will have to weather the stares (and perhaps a few words) from the people at the table who you are betting against. 3.4.4 Dont Pass Odds As with the pass line bet, you can also place an odds bet on your dont pass bet if a point is established. You are now betting that a 7 will be rolled before the point is made. This also pays true odds meaning that it pays 1-to-2 for 4 or 10, 2-to-3 for 5 or 9, and 5-to-6 for 6 or 8. 3.5 Summary Weve covered a lot in this page. The following table brings together our primary results in one place: Bet House Edge Pass Line 1.41% Dont Pass Line 1.36% Pass Line (with 1x odds) 0.81% Pass Line (with 2x odds) 0.61% Place: 6 or 8 1.52% Place: 5 or 9 4.00% Place: 4 or 10 6.67% Buy Bets 4.76% Big 6 or 8 9.09% Hard 6 or 8 9.09% Hard 4 or 10 11.11% Field (3-to-1 on 12) 2.78% Field (2-to-1 on 12) 5.56% Service: 2 or 12 13.89% Service: 3 or 11 11.11% Service: Any Craps 11.11% Service: Any 7 16.67% C&amp;E 11.11% "],["baccarat.html", "4 Baccarat 4.1 Overview 4.2 Simulation 4.3 Card Counting", " 4 Baccarat 4.1 Overview Baccarat is often mentioned as a classy game (James Bond plays it in movies) and one where billionaire whales can win (or lose) millions of dollars in a single night. It also has one of the smallest house edges in the casino. According to Wikipedia it is played with 6-8 decks and follows a somewhat complicated set of rules for dealing cards to a player and a banker. Observers of the game bet on whether the player or banker will win. They also can bet on a tie. According to Wikipedia, the typical payouts and house advantages for these scenarios (with a 8-deck shoe) are below: Outcome Payout House Edge Banker Wins 19-to-20 1.06% Player Wins 1-to-1 1.24% Tie 8-to-1 14.4% 4.2 Simulation I wrote a Baccarat simulator in Java to confirm these numbers. The simulator played 1 billion hands of Baccarat following the classic Punto Banco rules as described on Wikipedia. This took about 4 minutes to run. The results were: Winner Occurrences Percentage Banker Wins 458,618,223 45.8618223% Player Wins 446,309,890 44.6309890% Tie 95,071,887 9.5071887% Total 1,000,000,000 100.0000000% To calculate the expected return and house advantage we need to include the payouts that result from the bets for each scenario. This is shown in the table below: Outcome Return(B) Return(P) Return(T) Banker Wins 1.95 0 0 Player Wins 0 2.00 0 Tie 1.00 1.00 9.00 Return(B) indicates the money you receive in each scenario if you bet on the banker winning. Similarly, Return(P) and Return(T) represent bets placed on the player and a tie. When multiplying these returns by the probability of each scenario, the expected returns and house advantages for each bet are: Bet Expected Return House Advantage Banker 98.94% 1.06% Player 98.77% 1.23% Tie 85.56% 14.44% These match the results from Wikipedia to within +/- .01%. If we wanted to get fancy, we could calculate confidence intervals around our estimates. To do this, we make use of the fact that the Bernoulli distribution has a variance of p(1-p). This means that when calculating p as an average of N observations we would expect a standard deviation of p(1-p) / sqrt(N) around our estimate of the mean. This allows us to create the following confidence intervals around our probabilities: Outcome Estimate Stdev(Estimate) Min(Estimate) Max(Estimate) Banker Wins 45.8618223% 0.00157571% 45.8570952% 45.8665494% Player Wins 44.6309890% 0.001572% 44.6262730% 44.635705% Tie 9.5071887% 0.000927541% 9.5044061% 9.5099713% The Min and Max values of the estimate are calculated using 3 standard deviations. This means that we have a 99% chance of the true probability being somewhere between these two values. We can use these min and max estimates to calculate the payouts. This time we get: Bet Expected Return House Advantage Banker 98.93 - 98.95% 1.05 - 1.07% Player 98.76 - 98.78% 1.22 - 1.24% Tie 85.54 - 85.59% 14.41 - 14.46% 1 billion hands are needed in order to get confidence intervals this small. It is pleasing to see that the exact values from Wikipedia fall into our confidence ranges. 4.3 Card Counting Since Baccarat is played from a 6- or 8-deck shoe, you might naturally think there is an opportunity to count cards. The article below provides a great summary of several experts on this subject, each of them indicating that card counting is not practical in this game: https://www.888casino.com/blog/baccarat-tips/card-counting-in-baccarat The reason for this is that - unlike Blackjack - there are not cards that clearly favor the player or the banker. There are also no choices made in the game (except for your bet size), meaning that you cant use your knowledge of the deck to play the cards differently. Ed Thorp does provide a card-counting strategy that can yield an advantage to bets made on the player in rare scenarios. A positive advantage of 0.329% occurs every 1,786 hands, which is far too rare to use to your advantage. John May (a baccarat author) developed a counting strategy for betting on a tie that he claims yields a 62% advantage in certain rare scenarios. However, these rare scenarios occur approximately once every 10,000 hands - again making it too rare to be useful. If a player played Baccarat 40 hours a week, this scenario would occur only once every three weeks. "]]
